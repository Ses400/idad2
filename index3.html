Prompt 1: Try playing the game for a few rounds. How easy was it to understand what you were supposed to do without any text instructions, and what helped you figure it out? Was there anything confusing?</p>
<p>Prompt 2: When you made a mistake or got the sequence right, how did the game’s audio and visuals make you feel? Did the feedback clearly show success or failure, and was the difficulty progression fair?</p>
<p>For the Week 8 peer testing, most players said the game was intuitive and easy to understand after a round or two, even without written instructions since the title and flashing lights helped guide them to the correct interaction. However, some initially expected it to be a Simon says style game where sequences build step by step, so the introduction of entirely new sequences each round caused confusion and a few also noted that the reset option could be more obvious, suggesting stronger visual cues or placing the reset button at the top. They also suggested making failure feedback more distinct from success feedback, by making the grid reset to a different colour.</p>


In terms of feedback, players generally felt that the audio and visuals clearly communicated success and failure. The cheerful chime gave a sense of achievement and the buzzer made mistakes clear without being too discouraging. Still, many recommended improvements such as adding sound on every correct input instead of just the first or last or moving the “success” chime to play only after the full sequence is completed.


Opinions about difficulty progression were split but most people thought it was fair and straightforward, while others found it harsher than typical memory games since it replaced the sequence each round instead of building on it.

In response to the feedback, I will add audio feedback for the end of each sequence and shift the success chime to the end and for the failure states, I’ll make a red flash cover the entire grid to improve clarity when the user got something wrong. 
Overall, the testing confirmed the game is intuitive, simple, and engaging, but the feedback system and progression mechanics can be refined to improve clarity and player experience.
